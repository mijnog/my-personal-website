        <p>I am a Computer Science graduate from UNISA who just wants to understand how stuff works (especially technology) whether it's viewed from a high-level
             (with details abstracted away) or a low-level, where each detail is taken into consideration.</p>
        <p>I'm a curious minded individual and I'm interested in learning how to make and modify software for pen-testing purposes and hardware for red-teaming.</p>
        <p>I love music, zen video games, chess, and arena FPS shooters.</p>
        <p>I also love to solve CTF challenges on various websites e.g. <a href="https://www.overthewire.org">OverTheWire</a>, <a href="https://www.tryhackme.com">TryHackMe</a>, and <a href="https://www.hackthebox.com">Hack the Box</a></p>
        <p>I think Linux is awesome. I highly recommend using it if you're curious about how your operating system and the software running on it works. Everything is transparent on linux. Linux is awesome</p>
        <p>I am currently working on adding blogging functionality to my site. I plan to code it from scratch with as little use of frameworks as possible. No CMS! I might allow users to create accounts or login with their google accounts to leave comments on the blog posts and/or add a forum functionality</p>
